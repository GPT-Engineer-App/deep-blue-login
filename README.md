# deep-blue-login

A login page with a deep blue background. In the center, there is a white login box with a shadow effect that contains the following elements: - A header with the text 'SCU LOGIN' in bold. - Below the header, a smaller sub-header with the text 'Sign-In'. - Two input fields; the first for a username with an icon of a person, and the second for a password with an icon of a lock. - A 'Remember me' checkbox with accompanying text. - A blue 'Login' button. The text fields and button have rounded corners. The overall design is modern and minimalistic with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The color scheme includes deep blue and white, with the button in a slightly lighter shade of blue. Font style is clean and sans-serif.
